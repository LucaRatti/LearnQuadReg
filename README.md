Matlab codes for the supervised and unsupervised learning of a Generalized Tikhonov regularizer for linear inverse problems.
This set of codes deals with one-dimensional signals.
The original codes have been developed by Dr. Luca Ratti in 2021 related to a submitted publication.

The aim of the code is to replicate generalization bounds both for supervised and unsupervised learning, and assessing their independence from the dimension of the signal.
